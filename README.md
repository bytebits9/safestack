Safestack, database based on blockchain. With blockchain technology, the data is immutable, and any change will disrupt the integrity of the chain and corrupt the data. It is ideal for creating a database to store important documents. 

!! Be careful, currently the project is in pre-alpha stage and is not fit for use because it is still changing the API.
